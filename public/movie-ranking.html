<h1>The Best Movies According to Brian</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Transformers</h3>
<p>This one is a lot of fun watching cars transform into robots and jack stuff up. Megan Fox is also really hot.</p>

<h3>The Guardian</h3>
<p>Featuring Kevin Costner and Ashton Kutcher, it is a harrowing story of Coast Guard rescue swimmers.</p>

<h3>Up in the Air</h3>
<p>I love travel and watching this romance drama with George Clooney and Anna Kendrick is phenomenal. Be ready for an emotional pull towards the end.</p>
